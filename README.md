# Backend_Traini8_AmeyGhatale

Note : I have used MySQL database for storing all the data.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS : 
1. Before running the application create a database called traini8 in MySQL.
2. You do not have to create tables as it will generate automatically.
3. I have implemented swagger for easy user implementation
   (swagger link : "http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/"), you can use postman also if you like.
